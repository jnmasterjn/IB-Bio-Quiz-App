            <p>Hello there! ðŸ‘‹</p>
            <p>
                You're currently on the About page of my awesome trivia app, built with <strong>React</strong> on the front-end and <strong>Django</strong> as the back-end.
            </p>
            <p>
                Oh, and guess what? The database Iâ€™m using is none other than the simple but mighty <strong>SQLite</strong>. ðŸ’¾
            </p>
            <p>
                Is this all too fancy? Nah, I'm just goofing around and trying to make it look like Iâ€™m doing something complicated... but really, itâ€™s all good fun! ðŸ˜„
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyway, enjoy the trivia, and remember â€” the real challenge is not the app, but how well you know IB biology! ðŸ§¬ðŸ¦
